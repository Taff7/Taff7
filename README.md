Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think, learn, and perform tasks that typically require human cognition. These tasks include problem-solving, decision-making, language understanding, perception, and even creativity. AI systems are powered by algorithms and vast amounts of data, enabling them to improve over time through machine learning (ML), a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data without explicit programming.

AI can be categorized into narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks (e.g., facial recognition, chatbots), and general AI, a theoretical concept where machines possess human-like intelligence across diverse domains. Current advancements focus on narrow AI, which is already transforming industries like healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. Examples include virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa), recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Spotify), and autonomous vehicles.

AI also raises ethical and societal concerns, such as job displacement, bias in algorithms, and privacy issues. Despite these challenges, AI holds immense potential to solve complex global problems, enhance productivity, and improve quality of life. As technology evolves, the responsible development and deployment of AI will be critical to ensuring its benefits are widely accessible and its risks are mitigated.
